/*
	Stock Picker Application

    1. Stock Data Model
	2. Stock API (external data source + mocked data)
	3. Stock Fetcher (input + button)
	4. Stock Table (table + rows + remove)
	5. Persist Stocks

	The above are logical steps based on building functionality of the application

	TIP:  Each step should be followed by a refactor to make the code easier to maintain
